# Router - Mikrotik

MikroTik (officially SIA "Mikrotīkls") is a Latvian network equipment manufacturer. The company develops and sells wired and wireless network routers, network switches, access points, as well as operating systems and auxiliary software. The company was founded in 1996, and as of August 2019, the company website reported an estimated 280 employees. In 2021, with a value of EUR 1.24B, Mikrotik was the 3rd largest company in Latvia and the first private company to surpass EUR 1B value in Latvia.

## History
MikroTik was founded in 1996 by John Tully and Arnis Riekstiņš in Riga, Latvia, developing networking software for x86 PC hardware that would develop into a product called RouterOS. The earliest versions of RouterOS were based on Linux 2.2. In 2002, MikroTik began producing their own networking-focused low-power single-board computers, branded RouterBoard, that ran RouterOS. These early SBCs could be expanded and/or used as components of other systems, but as time passed, this RouterBoard/RouterOS platform would develop into a full line network equipment.

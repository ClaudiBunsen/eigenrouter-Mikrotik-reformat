# Provider: Online

It's a nice idea when your provider has the knowledge and experience to let you enjoy everything the internet has to offer without worry. Online.nl is one of the first providers in the Netherlands. We have been around since 1994, back then under the name Euronet. Together with other pioneers, we connected the Netherlands to the web and we were even the very first provider to sell internet access in shops.

Our 1994 installation manual stated: 'The internet is expected to develop into the communication tool of the future.' Now, almost 30 years later, we work, learn, play and create online. We shop, talk and meet online. We watch our TV series and movies online. The internet has become not just the means of communication, but a necessity of life. For everyone, from young to old.

We have been providing reliable and affordable internet services since 1994 and our professional staff are ready to help you. With us, you get it all as standard: with fibre-optic internet, low-cost call rates and interactive TV from Canal Digitaal. With more than 80 TV channels, CANAL+ Films & Series and Film1 as standard in your TV package. We offer 100% installation guarantee, free switching service, a free WiFi modem and much more. With no hidden costs and no worries.

We have never lost our pioneering spirit. Thus, together with our partner Canal Digitaal, we are still at the forefront of the interactive television revolution and we believe that fast internet and affordable calling should be available to everyone. We work with the latest technology, such as fibre optics, and we challenge the market by offering just a bit more for the same money.

We can no longer imagine a world without internet. Yet this is only the beginning. As in 1994, we dare to predict that it will become much bigger than it already is. That everything will be connected to everything. From our cities, roads, houses and cars to our refrigerators, doorbells and clothes. We work online, we learn online and even for our health we increasingly rely on the internet. In short: the future is online, just like us.

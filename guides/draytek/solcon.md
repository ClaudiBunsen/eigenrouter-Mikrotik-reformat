# Provider: Solcon

Solcon's ambition is to make more secure and manageable internet available to everyone in the Netherlands. Founded in 1996, provider Solcon focuses on consumer and small business SME customer groups.

Solcon believes that everyone should be able to enjoy the advantages of this digital world to the fullest and face as few disadvantages as possible. Solcon does this by providing customers with practical innovative tools and knowledge. In this way, customers can benefit from digital media in the most responsible and personal way possible.

Solcon offers a wide range of services, fully ISO27001-certified (consumer and business): from quad play (internet, television, telephony and mobile) to hosting. At Solcon, customers will find the most advanced filters and secure data storage. It also protects customers against internet crime such as malware, phishing and ransomware.

Nationwide, Solcon uses KPN's quality network. In fibre-optic outlying areas, Solcon operates different networks. In doing so, it deploys the latest technologies, such as GPON technology.

Solcon believes in the power of real contact. The customer care staff like to take the time for customers. No time pressure and interview protocols. And... Solcon is only satisfied when customers are. It wants to give customers the attention and service they deserve.

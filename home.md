# Welcome @ EIGENROUTER<area>.NL

Detailed how-to information about setting up Internet, IPTV & VoIP on your own router from different ISPs.
We will update this website with more types of routers to become a central place to find information.
If you have interest / knowledge in this area and want to help other people, leave a message for us so we can add you as a contributor!

We started this project because we think everyone should be able to use their own router.
Our goal is to create a central place for people to find router configurations and to keep it up-to-date with the latest changes.

Currently, we already have guides ready for the following ISP's and Routers.

## Routers
- pfSense
- OPNsense
- Mikrotik
- Draytek

## ISP's
- KPN
- T-Mobile
- Solcon
- Ziggo
- Online
- Delta

## Work in progress
- Ziggo (pfSense & OPNsense)

The list of routers and ISP's will grow during time!
